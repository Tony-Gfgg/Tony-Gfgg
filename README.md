- 👋 Hi, I’m Tony Gfgg!
  
- 👀 I’m a big fan of computers, anything tech related.

- 🏆My main achievements are creating a basic OS in Scratch, building a computer in Logisim, and getting 18th place in a game jam for a game about a ball-shaped chicken.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python & HTML, but I also know a bit of C & C#, Javascript, and Scratch (That block-coding language that means nothing on here.)
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also use itch.io, YouTube, and more. Below are links to my profiles.
