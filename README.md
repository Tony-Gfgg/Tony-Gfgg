- 👋 Hi, I’m Tony Gfgg!
  
- 👀 I’m a big fan of computers, anything tech related.

- 🏆My main achievements are creating a kinda functional OS (In scratch, but I plan to make a version for linux.), building my own computer in Logisim Evolution (Currently has 4 Bytes RAM, 3 Registers, 8 Bit Data)
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python & HTML, but I also know a bit of C#, C, Javascript, and Scratch (That block-coding language that means nothing on here.)
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also use itch.io, YouTube, and more. Below are links to my profiles.
